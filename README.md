🐍 Classic Snake Game in Python
This project is a recreation of the classic game Snake, developed from scratch to solidify Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and game state logic. It is finished work. Was focused on practicing basic game design and architecture. This was make with the help of IA (Gemini) to set the path to follow (Gemini was giving me the templates with some hints and i have to programm the logic.)

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone this repository.

Run the command: python main.py.

🧠 Key Learnings
While the recreation is quite simple, this project has provided me valuable insights into:

State Management: Understanding the distinction between the rendering loop and the calculation logic.

Inheritance: Extending the Turtle class to create a specialized Food class.

Logic Challenges: Solving the tail movement mechanics. After evaluating several options—such as managing a list of turtles and a separate list of positions to guide them—I concluded that reverse iteration was the most viable approach in terms of simplicity and code readability.

🚧 Current Status and Future Improvements
This is Version 2.0.

Status: Fully functional.

Add sound effects.

Fine-tune the UI/UX for a more polished aesthetic.

After of that all the features that i wanted will be implemented.
